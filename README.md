# Deep Tutorials for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)

This is a series of in-depth tutorials I'm writing for implementing cool deep learning models on your own with the amazing PyTorch library. 

Basic knowledge of PyTorch and neural networks is assumed.

If you're new to PyTorch, first read [Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) and [Learning PyTorch with Examples](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html).

**16 Jan 2019**: I've been really busy the last few months, and I'm finally getting back to these tutorials. Sorry about the delays. It takes me about two weeks to create the visuals and write the text for a tutorial, and this is _after_ the code is finished. The object detection tutorial should be up in about two weeks, and then the text classification in the middle of February.

In each tutorial, we will focus on a specific application or area of interest by implementing a model from a research paper.
