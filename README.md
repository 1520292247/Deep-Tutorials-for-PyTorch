# Deep Tutorials for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)

This is a series of in-depth tutorials I'm writing for implementing cool deep learning models on your own with the amazing PyTorch library. 

Basic knowledge of PyTorch and neural networks is assumed.

If you're new to PyTorch, first read [Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) and [Learning PyTorch with Examples](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html).

In each tutorial, we will focus on a specific application or area of interest by implementing a model from a research paper.
